### **1. Atoms**
They are the basic building blocks of matter.
- HTML tags
  - label
  - input
  - button
  - ...
- Abstract elements
  - color palettes
  - fonts
  - even more invisible aspects of an interface (animations)

### **2. Molecules**
Molecules are groups of atoms bonded together and are the smallest fundamental units of a compound.
- Example
  - A form is combined from label, input or button

### **3. Organisms**
Organisms are groups of molecules joined together to form a relatively complex, distinct section of an interface.

Organisms can consist of similar and/or different molecule types.

- Example
  - A header organism might consist of a logo, primary navigation, search form, and list of social media channels.
  - A 'product grid' organism might consist of the same molecule (a product image, title and price).

### **3. Templates**

Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together to form pages.

Templates are very concrete and provide context to all these relatively abstract molecules and organisms.

Templates are also where clients start seeing the final design in place.

### **4. Pages**

Pages are specific instances of templates
(placeholder content is replaced with real representative content).

Pages are the highest level of fidelity.

Pages are also the place to test variations in templates
